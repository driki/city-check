<li><a href="#1" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">improving page load time</span> to reduce user frustration.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Your page load time for <span class="textStrong">http://www.middletownnj.org</span> is currently <span class="textStrong">739ms</span>, which is pretty good, but users are now <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/technology/impatient-web-users-flee-slow-loading-sites.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">expecting an astounding 400ms</a> response time, don't blink or your residents are likely to click away. When we reviewed your site we found <span class="textStrong">43</span> images, that totaled <span class="textStrong">220KB</span>. Those extra bits and bytes in your images make a difference in how quickly your website loads. We're happy to tell you that your page load time was in the top <span class="textStrong">2%</span> compared to the other municipal websites we've reviewed. We did not find <span class="textStrong">HTTP Compression</span> being used on your website. Compression can get your page content to the user faster, it's a really simple way to increase speed and save on bandwidth.

<a name="2" href="#2" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#2" class="anchortitle"><h2>Consider <span class="textStrong">putting fewer links</span> on the page.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
When we reviewed your website homepage we found over <span class="textStrong">138 links</span> on the page. The good news is we found only <span class="textStrong">1</span> link that was broken, but lots of links means lots of choice and that much choice can confuse a resident or user. It also looks like you could benefit from having human readable URLs. A URL like <span class="textStrong">http://www.middletownnj.org/press/read/17a6b8d4</span> doesn't help the user or a computer figure out what the content is on that page, whereas <span class="textStrong">http://www.middletownnj.org/monmouth-county-fair-2013</span> does a much better job expressing what the user might find when following that link. A great example of citizen focused websites are <a href="http://gov.uk">http://gov.uk</a> and <a href="http://answers.honolulu.com">http://answers.honolulu.com</a>, you'll notice how they organize content that is focused on how citizens think about their needs.

<a name="3" href="#3" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#3" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">making contact information </span> more prominent on the page.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Good news! We did find some basic contact information for your city. It took a little investigation, but we found a phone number <span class="textStrong">732-615-2024</span> and <span class="textStrong">a street address</span> but unfortunately we couldn't find a <span class="textStrong">general feedback email</span>. Surprisingly, a <a href="http://www.monmouth.edu/assets/0/84/159/2147483694/4fd02537-cd3c-4ff3-9a91-f52ba3d49f65.pdf">Monmouth University study (PDF)</a> found that only 20% of municipal websites have a generic email address. A single published phone number or email address can give residents a simple way to ask their question. Links and documents are great, but sometimes we all just need to talk to a person. Placing contact information consistently in the footer is a great solution.

<a name="4" href="#4" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#4" class="anchortitle"><h2>Consider <span class="textStrong"> boosting search </span> instead of relying on navigation links.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Make sure your site has a search function, and if possible use Google Site search. Your vendor <span class="textStrong">CivicPlus</span> offers search as part of their solution, but c'mon we're talking about Google. It'd be great to place it in a prominent location on your website. We found that your search box was only <span class="textStrong">100px wide</span> by <span class="textStrong">16px tall</span>. This is a pretty small search box, we recommend that a search box be no smaller than 200px wide by 20px tall. We also found that your search box is sort of buried on the page, <span class="textStrong">400px from the top</span>, ideally your search box is located at the top of the page, users have come to expect it in the upper right hand corner or at least at the top of the page.
</span>

<a name="5" href="#5" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#5" class="anchortitle"><h2>Review <span class="textStrong">your analytics </span> to figure out what your residents want.</h2></a>
Yippee! We found that you are using <span class="textStrong">Google Analtyics</span> to collect information about what people are viewing and how they are interacting with your website. Consider spending time reviewing citizen interactions with your website. Knowing when your residents need something can really help you craft a useful homepage. Often the information that citizens are looking for is both periodic and episodic in nature. People generally don't look for snow parking ban information in July, whereas school registration information might be more useful in the spring. Ideally you can update your website content and navigation to reflect that. Partitioning your website visitors into those that live in your area versus those that don't might reveal interesting behavioral patterns.

<a name="6" href="#6" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#6" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">using Twitter, Facebook</span> to communicate rather than broadcast information.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Your residents are using services like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Pintrest, it looks like you are using <span class="textStrong">Facebook</span> and <span class="textStrong">Twitter</span> too. We reviewed your Twitter feed though, and it shows that you are mostly using it as a broadcast channel, only <span class="textStrong">2 of your recent Tweets</span> are a conversation with someone. Twitter can be a great way to have a dialog with your residents. The <a href="https://twitter.com/CoryBooker">Mayor of Newark, Corey Booker</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/311Somerville">Somerville, MA</a> a great examples of municipalities using Twitter to communicate with residents.

<a name="7" href="#7" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#7" class="anchortitle"><h2>Consider a <span class="textStrong">permissive robots.txt</span> file to allow web crawlers.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
A robots.txt file is used by web crawlers and search engines like Google or Bing to add your website content to their search engines. We've reviewed <a href="http://www.middletownnj.org/robots.txt">yours</a> and it looks great.
</span>
</li>



<a name="8" href="#8" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#8" class="anchortitle"><h2>Consider a vendor that <span class="textStrong">supports open source</span> instead of proprietary code.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Imagine if improvements to your website were made by talented engineers without you having to pay for it. It looks like your current vendor <span class="textStrong">CivicPlus</span> is using technologies from <span class="textStrong">Microsoft</span> and it's likely that the source code isn't readily available to your or your residents.
</span>
</li>



<a name="9" href="#9" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#9" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">removing images from your header</span> so that people focus on your content.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Yes, having beautiful photos of your city on your website might seem like a great idea, but most people who visit your website are there looking for a specific piece of information. The good news is that your website header is better than most, <span class="textStrong">taking up only 105px</span>. Consider setting up a unique promotional website for your town, one that is geared to attracting residents or new businesses. Your Chamber of Commerce or Economic Development office would be a good place for this information and brochure website.

<a name="10" href="#10" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#10" class="anchortitle"><h2>Consider publishing <span class="textStrong">clear copyright</span>, terms of service and a privacy policy.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
You can send your message with uncertainty trembling in your voice, or you can say it with confidence. If you're ending your messaging with question marks, using terms such as "perhaps", "maybe", "interested?" and "want to?", then most likely you have some opportunity to be a bit more authoritative. Who knows, maybe there is a bit more room for telling people what to do next in the world of conversion optimization.

<li><a href="#12" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">removing duplicate functionality</span> from your site.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
We found 5 links that pointed to the same place.

<a name="13" href="#13" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#13" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">stating who the information is for</span> instead of just presenting the information.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
There are 5 primary user personas that interact with a municipal website: 1) Resident, 2) Municipal Employee, 3) Business 4) Legal staff, 5) Researchers

</li>



<a name="14" href="#14" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#14" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">Exposing Options</span> instead of hiding them.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Each pull down menu that you use, hides a set of actions within which require effort to be discovered. If those hidden options are central along the path to getting things done by your visitors, then you might wish to consider surfacing them a bit more up front. Try to reserve pull down menus for options that are predictable and don’t require new learning as in sets of date and time references (ex: calendars) or geographic sets. Occasionally pull down menu items can also work for those interfaces that are highly recurring in terms of use - actions that a person will use repeatedly over time (ex: action menus). Becareful of using drop downs for primary items that are on your path to conversion.
</li>



<a name="15" href="#15" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#15" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">Suggesting Continuity</span> instead of false bottoms.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
A false bottom is a conversion killer. Yes, scrolling long pages are great, but be careful of giving your visitors a sense that the page has come to an end somewhere in between sections where it really hasn't. If your pages will scroll, try to establish a visual pattern or rhythm that the user can learn and rely on to read further down. Secondarily, be careful of big gaps in around the areas of where the fold can appear (of course I’m referring to a area range here with so many device sizes out there).</span>

<a name="16" href="#16" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#16" class="anchortitle"><h2>Consider <span class="textStrong">reviewing options</span> for municipal websites.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Most people will find your city information via a search engine like Bing or Google.</span>
