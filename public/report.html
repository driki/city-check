<li><a href="#1" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">improving page load time</span> to reduce user frustration.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Your page load time for <span class="textStrong">http://www.middletownnj.org</span> is currently <span class="textStrong">739ms</span>, which is pretty good, but users are now <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/technology/impatient-web-users-flee-slow-loading-sites.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">expecting an astounding 400ms</a> response time or they are more likely to click away. When we reviewed your site we found <span class="textStrong">43</span> images, that totaled <span class="textStrong">220KB</span>. Those extra bits and bytes in your images make a difference in how quickly your website loads. Your website page load time was in the top <span class="textStrong">2%</span> as compared to other municipal websites. You might want to ask your website vendor how they can speed up your page load times.

<a name="2" href="#2" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#2" class="anchortitle"><h2>Consider <span class="textStrong">putting fewer links</span> on the page.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
When we reviewed your website homepage we found over <span class="textStrong">138 links</span> on the page. The good news is we found only <span class="textStrong">1</span> link that was broken, but lots of links means lots of choice and that much choice can confuse a user. It also looks like you could benefit from having human readable URLs. A URL like <span class="textStrong">http://www.middletownnj.org/press/read/17a6b8d4</span> doesn't help the user or a computer figure out what the content is on that page, whereas <span class="textStrong">http://www.middletownnj.org/monmouth-county-fair-2013</span> does a much better job expressing what the user might find when following that link.

<a name="3" href="#3" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#3" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">making contact information </span> more prominent on the page.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Good news! We did find some basic contact information for your city. It took a little investigation, but we found a phone number <span class="textStrong">732-615-2024</span> and <span class="textStrong">a street address</span> but unfortunately we couldn't find a <span class="textStrong">general feedback email</span>. Surprisingly only 20% of municipal websites have a generic email address or a single published phone number that can give residents a simple way to ask their question.

<a name="4" href="#4" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#4" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong"> encouraging search </span> instead of relying on navigation links.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Google has trained us to search for information. Make sure your site has a search function, if possible use Google Site search, but place it in a prominent location on your website. We found that your search box was only <span class="textStrong">100px wide</span> by <span class="textStrong">16px tall</span>. This is a pretty small search box, we recommend that a search box be no smaller than 200px wide by 20px tall.
</span>
</li>



<a name="5" href="#5" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#5" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">looking at your analytics </span> to figure out what your users want.</h2></a>
Yippee! We found that you are using <span class="textStrong">Google Analtyics</span> to capture information about what people are viewing and how they are interacting with your website. Consider spending some time reviewing citizen interactions with your website. Knowing when they are looking for something can really help you craft a useful homepage. Often the information that citizens are looking for is both periodic and episodic in nature. People generally don't look for snow parking ban information in July, whereas school registration information might be more useful in the spring.

<a name="6" href="#6" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#6" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">using Twitter, Facebook</span> or other social tools to communicate rather than broadcast information.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Your citizens are using services like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Pintrest and it looks like you are using <span class="textStrong">Facebook</span> and <span class="textStrong">Twitter</span> too. A review of your Twitter feed though shows that you are mostly using it as a broadcast channel, only <span class="textStrong">2 recent Tweets</span> are a conversation. Twitter can be a great way to have a dialog with your residents. The Mayor of Newark, Corey Booker is a great example of a municipal employee using Twitter to interact with people.

<a name="7" href="#7" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#7" class="anchortitle"><h2>Consider a <span class="textStrong">permissive robots.txt</span> file to allow web crawlers.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
The robots.txt file is used by web crawlers and search engines like Google to add your website content to their search engines. We've reviewed yours (http://www.middletownnj.org/robots.txt) and it looks great.
</span>
</li>



<a name="8" href="#8" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#8" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">Undos</span> instead of prompting for confirmation.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Imagine that you just pressed an action button or link. Undos respect the initial human intent by allowing the action to happen smoothly first and foremost. Prompts on the other hand suggest to the user that he or she does not know what they are doing by questioning their intent at all times.

I would assume that most of the time human actions are intended and only in small situations are they accidental. The inefficiency and ugliness of prompts is visible when users have to perform actions repeatedly and are prompted numerously over and over - a dehumanizing experience. Consider making your users feel more in control by enabling the ability to undo actions and not asking for confirmation where possible.
</span>
</li>



<a name="9" href="#9" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#9" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">Telling Who It's For</span> instead of targeting everyone.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Are you targeting everyone or are you precise with your audience? This is a conversion idea where you could be explicit about who exactly your product or service is intended for. By communicating the qualifying criteria of your customers, you might be able to actually connect more with them while at the same time hinting at a feeling of exclusivity. The risk with this strategy of course is that you might be cutting yourself short and restricting potential customers. Then again, transparency builds trust.
</span>
</li>


<a name="10" href="#10" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#10" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">Being Direct</span> instead of indecisive.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
You can send your message with uncertainty trembling in your voice, or you can say it with confidence. If you're ending your messaging with question marks, using terms such as "perhaps", "maybe", "interested?" and "want to?", then most likely you have some opportunity to be a bit more authoritative. Who knows, maybe there is a bit more room for telling people what to do next in the world of conversion optimization.
</span>
</li>



<a name="11" href="#11" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#11" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">More Contrast</span> instead of similarity.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Making your calls to action be a bit more prominent and distinguishable in relation to the elements surrounding them, will make your UI stronger. You can easily increase the contrast of your primary calls to action in a number of ways. Using tone, you can make certain elements appear darker vs. lighter. With depth, you can make an item appear closer while the rest of the content looks like it's further (talking drop shadows and gradients here). Finally, you can also pick complementary colors from the color wheel (ex: yellow and violet) to raise contrast even further. Taken together, a higher contrast between your call to action and the rest of the page should be considered.
</span>
</li>



<a name="12" href="#12" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#12" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">Showing Where It's Made</span> instead of being generic.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Indicating where you, your product or service is from says quite a bit subliminally while at the same time moves your communication to a more personal level. Mentioning the country, state or city of origin is surely a very human like way to introduce oneself. If you can do the same virtually then you just might be perceived as a bit more friendly. Often, stating where your product is being made at also has a pretty good chance of making it feel of slightly higher quality. It's a win win.
</span>
</li>


<a name="13" href="#13" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#13" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">Fewer Form Fields</span> instead of asking for too many.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Human beings are inherently resistant to labor intensive tasks and this same idea also applies to filling out form fields. Each field you ask for runs the risk of making your visitors turn around and give up. Not everyone types at the same speed, while typing on mobile devices is still a chore in general. Question if each field is really necessary and remove as many fields as possible. If you really have numerous optional fields, then also consider moving them after form submission on a separate page or state. It's so easy to bloat up your forms, yet fewer fields will convert better.
</span>
</li>



<a name="14" href="#14" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#14" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">Exposing Options</span> instead of hiding them.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Each pull down menu that you use, hides a set of actions within which require effort to be discovered. If those hidden options are central along the path to getting things done by your visitors, then you might wish to consider surfacing them a bit more up front. Try to reserve pull down menus for options that are predictable and don’t require new learning as in sets of date and time references (ex: calendars) or geographic sets. Occasionally pull down menu items can also work for those interfaces that are highly recurring in terms of use - actions that a person will use repeatedly over time (ex: action menus). Becareful of using drop downs for primary items that are on your path to conversion.
</li>



<a name="15" href="#15" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#15" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">Suggesting Continuity</span> instead of false bottoms.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
A false bottom is a conversion killer. Yes, scrolling long pages are great, but be careful of giving your visitors a sense that the page has come to an end somewhere in between sections where it really hasn't. If your pages will scroll, try to establish a visual pattern or rhythm that the user can learn and rely on to read further down. Secondarily, be careful of big gaps in around the areas of where the fold can appear (of course I’m referring to a area range here with so many device sizes out there).</span>
</li>



<a name="16" href="#16" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#16" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">using a permissive Robots.txt</span> file.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Most people will find your city information via a search engine like Bing or Google.</span>
