  The website review below is customized for <span class="textGood">Middletown, NJ</span>. Our mission is to make every city and town website an <span class="textStrong">exceptional experience</span>, one that is <span class="textStrong">focused on the citizen</span>, while also <span class="textStrong">reducing effort</span> for municipal employees.

<li><a href="#1" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">improving page load time</span> to reduce user frustration.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Your page load time for <span class="textStrong">http://www.middletownnj.org</span> is currently <span class="textStrong">739ms</span>, which is pretty good, but users now <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/technology/impatient-web-users-flee-slow-loading-sites.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">expect an astounding 400ms</a> response time, don't blink or your residents are likely to click away. When we reviewed your site we found <span class="textStrong">43</span> images, that totaled <span class="textStrong">220KB</span>. Those extra bits and bytes in your images make a difference in how quickly your website loads. We're happy to tell you that your page load time was in the top <span class="textStrong">2%</span> compared to the other municipal websites we've reviewed. We did not find <span class="textStrong">HTTP Compression</span> being used on your website. Compression can get your page content to the user faster, it's a simple way to increase speed and save on bandwidth.

<a name="2" href="#2" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#2" class="anchortitle"><h2>Consider <span class="textStrong">putting fewer links</span> on the page.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
When we reviewed your homepage we found over <span class="textStrong">138 links</span> on the page. The good news is we only found <span class="textStrong">1</span> link that was broken, but lots of links means lots of choice and that much choice can confuse a resident or user. It also looks like you could benefit from having human readable URLs. A URL like <span class="textStrong">http://www.middletownnj.org/press/read/17a6b8d4</span> doesn't help the user or a computer figure out what the content is on that page, whereas <span class="textStrong">http://www.middletownnj.org/monmouth-county-fair-2013</span> does a much better job expressing what the user might find when following that link. Great examples of citizen focused websites are <a href="http://gov.uk">http://gov.uk</a> and <a href="http://answers.honolulu.com">http://answers.honolulu.com</a>, you'll notice how they organize content that is focused on how citizens think about their needs.

<a name="3" href="#3" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#3" class="anchortitle"><h2>Consider <span class="textStrong">making contact information </span> more prominent on the page.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Good news! We did find basic contact information for your city. It took a little digging, but we found a phone number <span class="textStrong">732-615-2024</span> and <span class="textStrong">a street address</span> but unfortunately we couldn't find a <span class="textStrong">general feedback email</span>. Surprisingly, a <a href="http://www.monmouth.edu/assets/0/84/159/2147483694/4fd02537-cd3c-4ff3-9a91-f52ba3d49f65.pdf">Monmouth University study (PDF)</a> found that only 20% of municipal websites have a generic email address. A single published phone number or email address in the footer can give residents a simple way to ask their question.

<a name="4" href="#4" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#4" class="anchortitle"><h2>Consider <span class="textStrong"> improving search </span> instead of relying on navigation links.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Make sure your site has a search function, and if possible use Google Site search. Your vendor <span class="textStrong">CivicPlus</span> offers search as part of their solution, but c'mon we're talking about Google. It'd be great to place it in a prominent location on your website. We found that your search box was only <span class="textStrong">100px wide</span> by <span class="textStrong">16px tall</span>. This is a pretty small search box, we recommend that a search box be no smaller than 200px wide by 20px tall. We also found that your search box is sort of buried on the page, <span class="textStrong">400px from the top</span>, ideally your search box is located at the top of the page, users have come to expect it in the upper right hand corner or at least at the top of the page.

<a name="5" href="#5" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#5" class="anchortitle"><h2>Review <span class="textStrong">your analytics </span> to figure out what your residents want.</h2></a>
Yippee! We found that you are using <span class="textStrong">Google Analtyics</span> to collect information about what people are viewing and how they are interacting with your website. Consider spending time reviewing citizen interactions with your website. Knowing when your residents need something can really help you craft a useful homepage. Often the information that residents are looking for is both periodic and episodic in nature. People generally don't look for winter parking ban information in July, whereas school registration information might be more useful in the spring. You can update your website content and navigation to reflect that.

<a name="6" href="#6" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#6" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">using Twitter or Facebook</span> to communicate rather than broadcast information.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Your residents use services like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Pintrest, it looks like you are using <span class="textStrong">Facebook</span> and <span class="textStrong">Twitter</span> too. We reviewed your Twitter feed though, and it shows that you are mostly using it as a broadcast channel, only <span class="textStrong">2 of your recent Tweets</span> are a conversation with someone. Twitter can be a great way to have a dialog with your residents. The <a href="https://twitter.com/CoryBooker">Mayor of Newark, Corey Booker</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/311Somerville">Somerville, MA</a> a great examples of municipalities using Twitter to communicate with residents.

<a name="7" href="#7" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#7" class="anchortitle"><h2>Consider a <span class="textStrong">permissive robots.txt</span> file to allow web crawlers.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
A robots.txt file is used by web crawlers and search engines like Google or Bing to add your website content to their search engines. We've reviewed <a href="http://www.middletownnj.org/robots.txt">yours</a> and it looks great.
</span>
</li>



<a name="8" href="#8" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#8" class="anchortitle"><h2>Consider a vendor that <span class="textStrong">supports open source</span> instead of proprietary code.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Imagine improvements or new features being added to your website constantly. Changes made by talented engineers, without you having to pay for them. It looks like your current vendor <span class="textStrong">CivicPlus</span> is using technologies from <span class="textStrong">Microsoft</span> and it's likely that the software source code isn't available to your or your residents to help improve. We checked <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> (Social Code) for

<a name="9" href="#9" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#9" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">removing images from your header</span> so that people focus on your content.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Yes, having beautiful photos of your city on your website might seem like a great idea, but most people who visit your website are there looking for a specific piece of information. The good news is that your website header is better than most, <span class="textStrong">taking up only 105px</span>. Consider setting up a unique promotional website for your town, one that is geared to attracting residents or new businesses. Your Chamber of Commerce or Economic Development office would be a good place for this information and brochure website. User <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/photos-as-web-content/">ignore content-free pictures</a> on websites. Local government websites are typically riddled with images like these.
</span>

<a name="10" href="#10" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#10" class="anchortitle"><h2>Consider publishing <span class="textStrong">clear copyright</span>, terms of service and a privacy policy.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
You can send your message with uncertainty trembling in your voice, or you can say it with confidence. If you're ending your messaging with question marks, using terms such as "perhaps", "maybe", "interested?" and "want to?", then most likely you have some opportunity to be a bit more authoritative. Who knows, maybe there is a bit more room for telling people what to do next in the world of conversion optimization.

<li><a href="#12" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">removing duplicate functionality</span> from your site.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
We found 5 links that pointed to the same place.

<a name="13" href="#13" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#13" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">stating who the information is for</span> instead of just presenting the information.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
There are  primary user personas that interact with a municipal website: 1) Resident, 2) Municipal Employee, 3) Business 4) Legal staff, 5) Researchers. Consider informing the user on each page who this information is for. It's unlikely that someone who runs a small business is interested in how to register a child for public school, but a resident certainly would be.

<a name="14" href="#14" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#14" class="anchortitle"><h2>Try <span class="textStrong">Exposing Options</span> instead of hiding them.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Your website navigation uses 'hover' to reveal additional menu items and choices. <a href="http://uxmovement.com/navigation/why-hover-menus-do-users-more-harm-than-good/">User research shows that hover menus can do more harm than good</a>.
</li>



<a name="15" href="#15" class="anchor"></a>
<li><a href="#15" class="anchortitle"><h2>Consider <span class="textStrong">photos of employees</span> reminding us that people work for the town.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
We mentioned earlier that photos on your website aren't helpful, but there are a certain type that are - photos of your employees. The Nielsen Norman Group research shows that people <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/about-us-information-on-websites/">"like getting a sense of the company" when visiting their website</a>. If there was ever an organization that could benefit from feeling a bit more personalized it's government. So, consider allowing your employees to add a casual photo, build that connection to the residents that might only know you via email.</span>

<li><a href="#16" class="anchortitle"><h2>Consider <span class="textStrong">reviewing options</span> for municipal websites.</h2></a>
<span class="description">
Most people will find your city information via a search engine like Bing or Google.</span>
